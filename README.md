# Expense-Tracker
This project is a simple and visually appealing **Expense Tracker Web Application** that allows users to track their income and expenses efficiently. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a clean and responsive design along with interactive components that make financial management easier and intuitive for users.

## Features

- Add income and expense transactions with category and date.
- View the overall balance, total income, and total expenses.
- Real-time search filter to find transactions by category.
- Edit or delete existing transactions with one click.
- Pie chart visualization of income and expense categories using Chart.js.
- LocalStorage integration to preserve data across page reloads and browser sessions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 
- JavaScript
- Chart.js (for visual representation of category-wise data)

## How It Works

1. Users can enter a transaction by selecting a date, entering the category, and amount.
2. Each transaction is stored in the browser’s LocalStorage, ensuring data persistence.
3. The summary section updates in real-time to show the latest income, expenses, and balance.
4. A pie chart dynamically displays the category-wise distribution of transactions.
5. Users can search, edit, or delete any transaction.
6. The application loads with previously saved data when revisited.
